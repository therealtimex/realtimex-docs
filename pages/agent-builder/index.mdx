# Agent Builder

The **Agent Builder** is a powerful visual workspace for creating custom [AI Agent skills](../agent/overview.mdx). Using a drag-and-drop interface and an integrated **AI Assistant**, you can build complex, multi-step automation "Flows" that extend the capabilities of your agents.

Capabilities of the Agent Builder are vast, ranging from simple web searches to complex API orchestrations and local file processing.

## Agent Flows vs Custom Skills

In RealTimeX, "Flows" are a simplified, no-code way to build agentic skills compared to the traditional code-based [custom agents](../agent/custom/introduction.mdx).

- **Agent Builder (Flows):** Visual, drag-and-drop, and AI-assisted. Designed for everyone.
- **Custom Skills (Code):** Built using Javascript/Node.js. Designed for developers who need maximum control.

## How to use Built Agents

Agent flows _work exactly the same_ as agent skills, the only difference is the way you build them. You can use agent flows in the same way you use agent skills via the `@agent` directive or by asking
a relevant question while in an agentic chat.

Agent flows are a very flexible way to build agentic skills and depending on the power of your LLM, you can even expect
the LLM to _chain multiple flows together_ to complete a task, or call a series of flows in a row to complete a task.
