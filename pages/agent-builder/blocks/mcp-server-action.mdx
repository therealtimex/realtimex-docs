# MCP Server Action Block

The **MCP Server Action** block allows you to call tools from any connected [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](../mcp-compatibility.mdx) server directly from your flow. This opens up your flows to a vast ecosystem of external integrations, from GitHub and Slack to local databases and custom scripts.

## How it Works

When you add an MCP Server Action block, it connects to your RealTimeX MCP runtime to fetch available tools.

### Configuration

1. **Select MCP Server**: Choose from your currently connected MCP servers.
2. **Select Tool**: Choose a specific tool provided by that server (e.g., `github_create_issue`, `slack_send_message`).
3. **Arguments**: The block will automatically generate input fields based on the tool's expected parameters. You can:
   - Enter static values.
   - Use flow variables with the `{{ $variable_key }}` syntax.

## Integration Example: GitHub Issue Creator

If you want your flow to automatically create a GitHub issue when a certain condition is met:

1. **Server**: `github`
2. **Tool**: `create_issue`
3. **Arguments**:
   - **Repository**: `therealtimex/RealTimeX`
   - **Title**: `[Flow Alert] {{ $alert_title }}`
   - **Body**: `Reported by agent flow. Data: {{ $api_response }}`

## Handling Results

The result of the MCP tool call is returned as a JSON object and stored in the block's **Result Variable**. You can then use this data in subsequent blocks.

<Callout type="info">
**Tool Availability**: Ensure the MCP server is enabled and running in your RealTimeX settings before running the flow. If a server is disconnected, the block will fail during execution.
</Callout>

## Benefits of MCP in Flows
- **Extensibility**: No need to wait for RealTimeX to add a specific integration; if an MCP server exists for it, you can use it.
- **Consistency**: Use the same tools in your flows that your AI agents use in chat.
- **Power**: Combine the logic of Agent Flows with the specialized capabilities of MCP tools to build complex, automated workflows.
