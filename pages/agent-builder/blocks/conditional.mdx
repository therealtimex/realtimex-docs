# Conditional Block

The **Conditional** block allows you to add branching logic to your flows. It evaluates a condition and executes a specific set of blocks based on whether the result is `true` or `false`.

## Configuration

To configure a Conditional block, you need to define a **Variable**, an **Operator**, and a **Value**.

### 1. Select Variable
Choose a variable from your flow context (e.g., `$api_response.status` or `$user_input`). You can use the `{{ $variable_name }}` syntax to reference variables.

### 2. Choose Operator
The block supports various operators for comparison:

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **equals (==)** | Checks if the variable exactly matches the value. |
| **not_equals (!=)** | Checks if the variable does not match the value. |
| **greater_than (`>`)** | Numeric comparison: variable is greater than value. |
| **less_than (`<`)** | Numeric comparison: variable is less than value. |
| **contains** | Checks if a string or array contains the specified value (case-insensitive). |
| **starts_with** | Checks if a string starts with the specified value. |
| **is_empty** | Checks if the variable is null, undefined, or an empty string. |

### 3. Define Value
The value to compare against. This can be a static string, a number, or another variable reference using `{{ $other_var }}`.

## Branching
The Conditional block has two output paths:

- **True Path**: Blocks connected here will execute if the condition is met.
- **False Path**: Blocks connected here will execute if the condition is NOT met.

<Callout type="info">
If no blocks are connected to a path, the flow will simply skip that branch and proceed to the next block after the Conditional block (if any).
</Callout>

## Example: Response Check
Imagine you are making an API call and want to check if it was successful:

1. **Variable**: `{{ $api_call.status }}`
2. **Operator**: `==`
3. **Value**: `200`

- **True Path**: Send a success notification.
- **False Path**: Log an error and stop the flow.

## Tips
- **Type Conversion**: RealTimeX automatically tries to parse values as numbers or booleans if they look like them. For example, "true" will be treated as a boolean `true`.
- **Nested Logic**: You can place Conditional blocks inside other Conditional blocks or Loops for complex decision-making.
