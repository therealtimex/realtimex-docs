# Flow Scheduling

While many Agent Flows are triggered manually during a chat session, RealTimeX also supports powerful **Background Scheduling**. This allows you to run flows automatically on a recurring basis without any manual intervention.

## Scheduling Modes

You can configure the schedule for a flow in the **Start Block** settings.

### 1. Manual (Default)
The flow only runs when explicitly called by an agent or a user in chat.

### 2. Interval
Runs the flow repeatedly after a set amount of time.
- **Options**: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months.
- **Example**: "Run every 30 minutes" or "Run every 2 days at 9:00 AM".

### 3. Schedule (One-time)
Sets a flow to run at a specific date and time in the future.
- **Example**: "Run on 2026-12-25 at 00:00".

### 4. Custom Cron
For advanced users, you can use standard Cron expressions to define complex recurring schedules.
- **Example**: `0 0 * * 1-5` (Run at midnight every weekday).

## Timezone Handling
RealTimeX uses **UTC** as the default timezone for scheduling. However, you can specify a custom timezone in the Start block configuration to ensure the flow runs at the correct local time for your region.

## Execution History & Monitoring

Scheduled flows run in the background. You can monitor their performance and results through:

- **Flow Logs**: Check the "Logs" tab in the flow builder to see a history of every run, including successful completions and any errors.
- **Calendar Integration**: If your flow creates calendar events, you can see these in the RealTimeX workspace calendar.
- **Notifications**: You can build flows that send an email or Slack message (via MCP) upon completion or failure.

**System Availability**: For scheduled flows to run, your RealTimeX instance (Docker or Desktop) must be active and running on your machine.

## Best Practices
- **Rate Limiting**: When using short intervals (e.g., every 60 seconds), ensure your LLM and API providers can handle the frequency.
- **Error Handling**: Build your flows robustly. Use [Conditional Blocks](./blocks/conditional) to check if an API call failed and stop the flow or send an alert.
- **Overlap Protection**: By default, RealTimeX prevents a new instance of a scheduled flow from starting if the previous one is still running.
