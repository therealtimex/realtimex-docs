# Getting Started with Agent Builder

The Agent Builder is your workspace for creating custom flows and agents. Let's walk through the core interface and how to build your first flow.

## Accessing the Builder

To open the Agent Builder, navigate to **Settings > Agent Flows** (or click the flow icon in your workspace) and click **"Create Flow"**.

## Using the AI Builder Assistant

Instead of building manually, you can use the **AI Assistant** in the left panel to generate your flow through chat. Simply describe your goal, and the assistant will handle the block placement and configuration for you.

Learn more in the [AI Builder Assistant guide](./ai-assistant).

## Understanding the Canvas

The main area is a blank canvas where you connect blocks. Every new flow starts with three essential steps:

1. **Flow Information** - Defines the flow's name and description (critical for LLM discovery).
2. **Flow Variables** - Sets up the input/output variables for the flow.
3. **Flow Complete** - Marks the successful termination point.

You can learn more about these in the [Default Blocks documentation](./blocks/default-blocks).

## Adding New Blocks

To add functionality, click the **"+" (plus)** icon between any two blocks or on any block handle. This opens the **Block Picker**.

  Check the [blocks documentation](./blocks/intro) to see which blocks are available in your deployment.

## The Variable System

One of the most powerful features of Agent Builder is the variable system, allowing blocks to share data.

### Referencing Variables
Use the double-curly brace syntax: `{{ $variable_name }}` in any text field.

- **Predefined Variables**: Defined in the `Start` block (e.g., `{{ $user_input }}`).
- **Output Variables**: Stored results from any block (e.g., `{{ $api_result }}`).
- **JSON Traversal**: Access nested data like `{{ $api_result.data.items[0].id }}`.
