# Agent Developer Guide

This guide is for developers building AI Agents that process data from Local Apps.

## How Agents Receive Tasks

When a Local App triggers an agent (via SDK or Supabase event), RealTimeX creates an **External Task**.

1. **Agent triggered**: The agent receives the `raw_data` from the event.
2. **Processing**: The agent runs its logic (e.g., summarizing text, analyzing data).
3. **Reporting**: The agent must report the result back to RealTimeX.

## Responding to Tasks

Agents should use the **Report Result** tool (if using the RealTimeX Agent framework) or call the webhook directly.

### Webhook URL

The agent receives a `webhook_url` in its context (or can construct it from the task UUID).
`POST /external-tasks/:uuid/webhook`

### Payload Format

```json
{
  "status": "completed", // or "failed"
  "output": "The analysis is complete...",
  "data": {
    "key_results": [...]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Handle Large Payloads
If `raw_data` is very large, consider storing it in Supabase Storage and passing the URL instead of the full content.

### 2. Error Handling
Always return a meaningful error message in the `output` field if the processing fails. This will be visible in the Local App logs and the main App calendar.

### 3. State Management
AI Agents are stateless. Any state between steps should be maintained in your database (Supabase) and updated using the SDK.

## Local Testing

To test your agent locally before deploying:
1. Use the **SDK** to trigger a "Manual" event.
2. Verify the task appears in the **Calendar**.
3. Use the **"Trigger Agent"** button in the Calendar to run your agent manually.
4. Check the **Execution Logs** for results.
