# Speech‑to‑Text (Walkie‑Talkie)

Use Speech‑to‑Text (STT) to dictate messages directly into the chat composer. Click to start/stop listening; short pauses finalize the text for you.

## Start dictation

1. In the chat composer, click the STT mic button (Walkie‑Talkie).
2. Speak your message. You’ll see text appear in the input.
3. Click the mic button again to stop, or pause briefly — STT will finalize automatically.
4. Press Send, or enable auto‑submit to send immediately.

Keyboard shortcut: Press Ctrl+M to toggle STT on/off.

## Providers & languages

- STT can run with different providers depending on your workspace settings:
  - Native (browser built‑in)
  - Local Whisper (on‑device)
  - Cloud STT (e.g., Groq)
- Choose your preferred language from the language selector next to the mic.

## Auto‑submit (optional)

- Enable “Auto‑submit speech input” to send your dictated message as soon as it finalizes.
- Otherwise, you can edit the text in the input and click Send when ready.

## Tips

- Speak clearly and at a steady pace
- Pause briefly between sentences for best results
- Use a quiet environment or headset microphone when possible

## Troubleshooting

- Mic access was denied
  - Allow the microphone in your browser permissions and try again.
- Nothing appears while speaking
  - Ensure your input device is correct and not muted in your OS audio settings.
