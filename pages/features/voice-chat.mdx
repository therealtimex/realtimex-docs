# Voice Chat (Hands‑Free)

Voice Chat lets you talk to the assistant hands‑free. Speak naturally; short pauses create turns automatically. The assistant reads replies out loud while Voice Chat is open.

## Start a voice conversation

1. Click the microphone in the chat composer to open Voice Chat.
2. Wait for the short “ready” chime and animated audio dots.
3. Speak naturally. A brief pause creates a turn; the assistant replies aloud.
4. Use the mic button to pause/resume listening, or the X to end.

Tip: Press Esc to quickly close Voice Chat.

## How turns work

- You do not need to click for every sentence. Voice Chat detects natural pauses.
- Each pause finalizes one “turn” and sends it to the assistant.
- Long dictation is supported — Voice Chat won’t cut you off just because of time.

## Hearing replies (text‑to‑speech)

- While Voice Chat is open, replies auto‑play.
- If you don’t hear audio:
  - Check device volume and tab mute state.
  - If your browser blocks autoplay, click the speaker icon on a message once. Future replies should play automatically.

## Panel controls

- Mic button: pause/resume listening (mute/unmute)
- X button: end Voice Chat
- Audio dots: show current speaking level

## Tips for clear results

- Speak at a normal pace and volume
- Pause briefly between ideas
- Reduce background noise or use a headset

## Troubleshooting

- Microphone access denied or not prompted
  - Allow microphone in your browser’s site permissions and reopen Voice Chat.
- Voice Chat hears nothing
  - Check your input device in OS settings. Ensure the mic isn’t muted.
- Replies not playing
  - Increase volume; ensure tab isn’t muted. Click a message’s speaker icon once to allow audio.

## Privacy & data

- Your microphone audio is used to detect speech and transcribe your words into text.
- Depending on your workspace settings, transcription may happen locally or via a configured cloud provider.
- Audio isn’t stored by default.
