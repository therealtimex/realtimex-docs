# What is the RealTimeX Marketplace?

The [RealTimeX Marketplace](https://marketplace.realtimex.ai) is a community-driven platform for RealTimeX users to share, discover, and install advanced AI assets. From specialized agent skills to complex automated flows, the Marketplace is the central hub for extending the capabilities of your RealTimeX instance.

The Marketplace enables you to share your own creations with the community both **publicly** (for everyone) and **privately** (within your organization or for personal use).

### Supported Item Types

RealTimeX supports a wide variety of item types that can be synced directly to your desktop or cloud instance:

- **Agent Skills**: Custom functional blocks for your agents (built with Node.js).
- **Agent Flows**: Visual, no-code automated workflows and logic.
- **AI Agents**: Pre-configured agent personas with specialized knowledge and tools.
- **MCP Servers**: Model Context Protocol integrations for local or remote tools.
- **Local Apps**: Integration blocks for local scripts (Python, Node, etc.).
- **System Prompts**: Curated system instructions for specific use cases.
- **Slash Commands**: Quick-access shortcuts for frequent agent tasks.

### Why use the Marketplace?

- **Instant Extensibility**: Don't reinvent the wheel—leverage specialized agents and skills created by experts.
- **Organization Sharing**: Shared private assets across your team's RealTimeX instances.
- **No-Code Integration**: Sync complex flows and local app configurations with a single click.
- **Version Control**: Stay up to date with the latest versions of your favorite skills and agents.
