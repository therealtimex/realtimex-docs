# What is the RealTimeX Marketplace?

The [RealTimeX Marketplace](https://marketplace.realtimex.ai) is a platform and marketplace for RealTimeX users to share system prompts, slash commands, agent skills, and more.

The Marketplace enables you to share your own items, skills, and workflows with the RealTimeX community both **publicly** and **privately**.

Currently, the RealTimeX Marketplace is in **beta** and as such, not all types of items are supported.

### Current Supported Item Types

- [x] Agent Skills
- [x] System Prompts
- [x] Slash Commands

_More item types are coming soon!_

- [ ] Workspaces
- [ ] Data Connectors
- [ ] Authentication Providers
