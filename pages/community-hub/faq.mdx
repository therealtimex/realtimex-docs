## Connecting to the RealTimeX Marketplace

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ”‘">
  Only pulling **private** items from the RealTimeX Marketplace requires a
  Connection key. Public items do not require a Connection key and can be pulled
  in without one. To create a Connection key, visit your [profile page on the
  RealTimeX Hub](https://marketplace.realtimex.ai/me) and click the **Create
  Connection Key** button.

Connecting to the RealTimeX Marketplace requires a Connection key. You can find your Connection key by visting your [profile page on the RealTimeX Hub](https://marketplace.realtimex.ai/me) and copying or creating a new Connection key.

  }}

## No private items

The RealTimeX Marketplace offers both public and private items. When you create an item, you can choose to make it private or public.

Public items are visible to all users of RealTimeX. **Private items are only visible to you and Teams** you share the tools with that you also have access to.

If you are trying to pull in a private item from the RealTimeX Marketplace:

- Ensure you are logged in with the same account you used to create the item.
- You are using the correct [Connection key](#connecting-to-the-RealTimeX-community-hub) in RealTimeX.
- The item has been shared with at **least** one of your Teams.

## Verification

Some items in the RealTimeX Marketplace are verified by the RealTimeX team. These items are marked with a blue checkmark and a label that says **Verified**.

  height={1080}
  style={{
    margin: "5px",
    borderRadius: "10px",
  }}
/>

Verified items have been reviewed by the RealTimeX team to ensure they are safe and working as expected. Verification is not a guarantee of quality or safety, but rather a signal that the RealTimeX team has reviewed the item and believes it is safe to use.

You will only see verification badges for public items that are:

- Agent Skills
- Data Connectors
- Workspaces

The RealTimeX team will review and verify items on a best-effort basis. If you believe an item should be verified, please let us know by [contacting support](mailto:team@realtimex.ai).
