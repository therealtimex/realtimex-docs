  If you expect to use a block in your flow, but it is not available - you are probably using the wrong version of RealTimeX.

  <u>**Please do not open a support ticket about a missing block without first checking the block docs.**</u><br/>
  
  If a block is only available on RealTimeX Desktop, we will show a warning on the block's doc page. Otherwise, you can assume the block is available in all versions of RealTimeX.

## Overview

Learn about the blocks that are available to you in the flow editor. Keep in mind that the blocks available to you will vary depending on the type of deployment of RealTimeX you are using.
