# Desktop Installation Overview

RealTimeX Desktop is the easiest way to experience RealTimeX on your own terms. Just install the app on Mac, Windows, or Linux and get started with local LLMs, RAG, and Agents—no complicated setup, and your data stays private.

## Desktop vs Cloud: What’s Right for You?

RealTimeX is available in two main versions, each designed for different needs. Here’s a quick comparison to help you choose:

### You’ll love **RealTimeX Desktop** if:

- You want a simple, one-click app for local LLMs, RAG, and Agents
- You don’t need multi-user access
- You want everything to stay on your device
- You don’t plan to publish chat widgets or make your instance public

### Choose **RealTimeX Cloud** if:

- You need a server-based service to use cloud LLMs, RAG, and Agents
- You want to support multiple users at once
- You’d like to share your instance or invite team members
- You need admin controls, workspace management, or public chat widgets
- You want to access RealTimeX from any browser

Here’s how the two options compare on key features:
