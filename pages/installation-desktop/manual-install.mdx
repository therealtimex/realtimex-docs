  **Note:** This documentation is for Windows only and should only be used if
  you are experiencing issues with the automatic dependency installation that
  occurs during the installation process of the RealTimeX Desktop executable.
</Callout>

When installing RealTimeX Desktop on Windows you may have been notified that external dependencies were missing. This is because RealTimeX Desktop uses a local LLM powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) which requires some additional dependencies to be installed on your system.
Since we do not include these dependencies in the RealTimeX Desktop executable to keep the file size small, we download them from a hosted S3 bucket during the installation process.

If you are in a geographic region that is restricted from accessing the S3 bucket automatically during the installation process (like VPN related), you can manually install the dependencies using the below instructions.

## Manual Dependency Installation

### Download the Dependency Bundle

_We are currently on Ollama 0.5.4_

Download the [bundle](https://cdn.realtimex.ai/support/ollama/0.5.4/win32_lib.zip) from the RealTimeX S3 bucket.

_direct link:_ https://cdn.realtimex.ai/support/ollama/0.5.4/win32_lib.zip

### Extract the Dependency Bundle

Right-click > Extract files to a folder called `win32_lib` on your desktop. It should suggest this default folder name.

### Copy the Dependency Bundle to the RealTimeX Desktop Application

Open the `Program Files` for the installed RealTimeX Desktop application. This is typically located at `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\RealTimeX`.

Open the `resources/ollama` folder inside the RealTimeX Desktop application folder.

Open the `win32_lib` folder created during the extraction of the zip file. Inside this folder you will see a folder called `lib`.

Copy the `lib` folder and paste it into the `ollama` folder inside the RealTimeX Desktop application folder.

You should now be able to run the RealTimeX Desktop internal LLM with full GPU,CPU,NPU support.

## Alternative: Install Ollama Directly

If you cannot unable to access the S3 bucket at all on your internet connection, you should just install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) directly and select that LLM as your provider in RealTimeX.
