# MacOS Installation

## Install using the installation file

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Install the right dmg!**

Make sure you downloaded the correct `dmg` for your device! We support both types of chips found in MacOS devices.

➤ Apple Silicon devices (M1/M2/M3)

➤ Apple (Intel)

</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
  **PERFORMANCE** ➤➤ Apple M-Series chips run local LLM inferencing
  **considerably** faster than Intel-based Mac.
</Callout>

### Downloading the installation file from https://realtimex.ai

Your internet browser may need you to verify you want to download and run the RealTimeX Desktop app since it may be marked as "untrusted" depending on your browser security settings.

Click "**Keep**" when downloading to allow the file to download.

### Installing the application

After downloading the `.dmg` file from the link in the invitation email, you will want to double-click on the resulting installed file.

Once the dmg opens, you can drag the RealTimeX logo into `Applications`

Once installed, you will find RealTimeX in your Applications folder as well as you can use `cmd + spacebar` and type in RealTimeX to run.
