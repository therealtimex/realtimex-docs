# Updating RealTimeX

Keeping RealTimeX up to date is easy. You donâ€™t need to hunt for download links or reinstall the app every time thereâ€™s an update. Whenever a new version is available, RealTimeX will automatically let you know right inside the app.

  **How it works:**  
  When a new update is released, youâ€™ll see a notification in RealTimeX with simple instructions. Just follow the prompts in the app to download and install the latest version. All your data and settings will stay safe and intact.

## What about manual updates?

If you ever prefer to update manually, you can always download the latest installer for your operating system from the [RealTimeX download page](https://realtimex.ai/). Just run the installer for your platform (Mac, Windows, or Linux), and it will take care of everythingâ€”your settings and data will be preserved.
