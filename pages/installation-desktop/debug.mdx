## General Debugging

If you are having issues with RealTimeX, the first thing you should do is check the logs. You can find the logs in the `logs` folder of your RealTimeX storage - which you can find [on your computer using this guide.](./storage.mdx#where-is-my-data-located)

## RealTimeX Debug mode on MacOS

To run the RealTimeX Application in debug mode (if you are getting errors) you can open a Terminal and navigate to `~/Applications/RealTimeX/Content/MacOs` where you can then run the executable and see all application logs while running RealTimeX.

## RealTimeX Debug mode on Windows

To run the RealTimeX Application in debug mode (if you are getting errors) you can open a CMD or Powershell window and run the path to the RealTimeX executable. Typically this is in `C:\Users\usr\AppData\Local\Programs\RealTimeX-desktop\RealTimeXDesktop.exe`.
This will print all logs to the powershell window while running and should display a verbose error once encountered that is critical for debugging.

## RealTimeX Debug mode on Linux

To run the RealTimeX Application in debug mode (if you are getting errors) you can open a Terminal and navigate to `~/.config/RealTimeX-desktop/RealTimeXDesktop.AppImage` where you can then run the executable and see all AppImage logs while running RealTimeX.
