# What are Beta Previews?

Beta previews of RealTimeX are versions or features that are:

- In active development
- Unstable or untested
- Not fully completed, but available for community feedback

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ§ª">
  Beta features let you try the newest RealTimeX ideasâ€”sometimes before theyâ€™re even public! We appreciate your feedback.
</Callout>

# Types of Beta Previews

Beta previews can be shared in several ways:
- As a completely separate Docker image
- As a special version of the [desktop application](/installation-desktop/macos)
- As hidden features already present inside RealTimeX
