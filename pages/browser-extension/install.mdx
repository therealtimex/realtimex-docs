# About the RealTimeX Browser Extension

The RealTimeX Browser Extension is a tool that allows you to connect your RealTimeX instance to your browser. This allows you to send and embed information from the web directly to RealTimeX or embed directly into your workspaces for later!

With the browser extension, you can:

- Send entire webpages or just highlighted text snippets to RealTimeX
- Embed information directly into your RealTimeX workspaces
- Collect or embed web content that is password protected, VPN protected, or otherwise inaccessible to the public internet straight from your browser.

_All offerings of RealTimeX support the browser extension._

# Customizing the Browser Extension

**_Docker only:_**
By default, the image in the browser extension is the RealTimeX logo. However, it will automatically use the logo of the instance you are connected to if set in the `Customization` section of the settings page.

If you want to further customize the browser extension, you can do so by forking the [RealTimeX Browser Extension GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/RealTimeX-extension) and making your own changes.

Once you have made your changes, you can build the extension using the `yarn build` command.

After building the extension, you can load it into your browser by clicking the `Load unpacked.` button in Chrome and selecting the `dist` folder.
