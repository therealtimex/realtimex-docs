## Installation Overview

RealTimeX Docker is both a **single-user** and **multi-user** application you can install on any webserver using docker and leverage local LLMs, RAG, and Agents with little to zero configuration and full privacy.

Self hosting RealTimeX via Docker is very popular and can be done locally or on cloud servicers (aws, google cloud, railway etc..).

## Docker vs Desktop Version

<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
  **Tip:** RealTimeX Desktop is the easiest way to get started with RealTimeX.

  If you dont need multi-user support - you should use RealTimeX Desktop.

There are some distinct differences in functionality between each offering. Both are open source.

### You want RealTimeX Docker if...

- You need an easy setup, but server-based service for RealTimeX to use local LLMs, RAG, and Agents locally
- You want to run an RealTimeX instance that many people can use at the same time
- You want to be able to share information with our users on your instance you invite
- You need admin and rule-based access for workspaces and documents.
- You will publish chat widgets to the public internet
- You want to access RealTimeX from the browser

### You want RealTimeX Desktop if...

- You want a one-click installable app to use local LLMs, RAG, and Agents locally
- You do not need multi-user support
- Everything needs to stay only on your device
- You do not need to "publish" anything to the public internet. Eg: Chat widget for website

The below table is a non-exhaustive list of features supported between platforms.
