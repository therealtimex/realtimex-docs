_The provided instructions below assume you are running RealTimeX via the [official startup command](quickstart)._

### Using any `localhost` service when running RealTimeX in Docker

When running RealTimeX in Docker, you may need to connect to a service running on localhost.

This could be be any of the following:
- A PostgreSQL database
- An LLM, Embedding, or Vector Database provider (LMStudio, Ollama, Chroma, etc)
- Any other service running on the same machine where you are using `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `0.0.0.0` to connect it with RealTimeX

## `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0` Will Not Work!

When running RealTimeX in Docker, the `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `0.0.0.0` addresses do not exist in the container!

This means when you are using `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `0.0.0.0` in any connection configuration, they will not work as expected because these connections never leave the RealTimeX container.

## How to connect to a service running on localhost

If you need to connect to a service running on localhost or even a service running in another Docker container simply
modify anywhere you are using `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `0.0.0.0` to use the `host.docker.internal` address instead.

### Note about Linux

On Linux, you must use the `172.17.0.1` address instead of `host.docker.internal` to connect to the host machine.


### Examples

```text copy showLineNumbers
# PostgreSQL
postgresql://dbuser:dbpassword@localhost:5432/dbname => postgresql://dbuser:dbpassword@host.docker.internal:5432/dbname

# Ollama
http://localhost:11434" => http://host.docker.internal:11434

# Chroma
http://localhost:8000" => http://host.docker.internal:8000

# LMStudio
http://localhost:1234" => http://host.docker.internal:1234
```
