# Run RealTimeX on Cloud using Docker

Running RealTimeX on a cloud service is the best way to run a private multi-user instance of RealTimeX with full control while not having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  **Easy Cloud Deployment**

    RealTimeX offers easily integrated one-click docker deployment templates with [Railway](https://railway.app/template/HNSCS1?referralCode=WFgJkn) and [Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm&branch=render).

    _This is the easiest way to self-host a cloud server version of RealTimeX_

</Callout>

| Provider              | Minimum Instance size |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Amazon Web Services   | t3.small              |
| Google Cloud Provider | e2-standard-2         |
| Azure Cloud           | B2ps v2               |

  RealTimeX offers community-maintained deployment templates for cloud
  providers

Once you are prepared to run RealTimeX on your server the process is quite simple.

You should provision a folder somewhere on the host machine so that you can re-pull the latest versions of RealTimeX and persist data between container rebuilds.

  **BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY**

    The RealTimeX, Inc team takes great care to ensure RealTimeX is always backward compatible.

    In the event this changes you will be alerted via code, deployment, or our regular communication channels on social, Discord, and email.

  **Note** `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN` is a **required** command if you want to scrape
  webpages. We use [PuppeeteerJS](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to
  scrape websites links and `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN` lets us use sandboxed Chromium
  across all runtimes for best security practices.

```shell copy showLineNumbers
 # Assuming that you want to store app data in a folder at /var/lib/RealTimeX

 # Pull in the latest image
 docker pull mintplexlabs/RealTimeX:master

 export STORAGE_LOCATION="/var/lib/RealTimeX" && \
 mkdir -p $STORAGE_LOCATION && \
 touch "$STORAGE_LOCATION/.env" && \
 docker run -d -p 3001:3001 \ # expose on port 3001 (can be any host port)
 --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
 -v ${STORAGE_LOCATION}:/app/server/storage \
 -v ${STORAGE_LOCATION}/.env:/app/server/.env \
 -e STORAGE_DIR="/app/server/storage" \
 mintplexlabs/RealTimeX:master

 # visit http://localhost:3001 to use RealTimeX!
```

Done! You are using RealTimeX!


## More Information

### Backwards Compatibility

The RealTimeX, Inc team takes great care to ensure RealTimeX is always backward compatible.
In the event this changes you will be alerted via code, deployment, or our regular communication channels on social, Discord, and email.

### Scaling

Since the RealTimeX backend uses SQLite for its database, it is not recommended to attempt to scale the RealTimeX backend horizontally
since you would then need to have many containers all reading and writing to the same database.

In this case, we recommend using a more robust database like PostgreSQL and our [PostgreSQL image](/installation-docker/available-images#pg) which will centralize the database as well as set `PGVector` as the vector database.

### SSL/HTTPS Support

In order to use SSL/HTTPS with RealTimeX you should use a reverse proxy like [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) with a TLS certificate you can get from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

### NGINX Configuration

Here is an example NGINX configuration that you can use to reverse proxy to RealTimeX:

```nginx
# Default server configuration
# Example config for regular setup + SSL + Websockets.
server {
	listen 80;
	server_name your-domain.com;
	return 301 https://your-domain.com$request_uri;
}

server {
	listen 443 ssl;
	ssl on;
	server_name your-domain.com;
	ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
	ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;	

  # Enable websocket connections for agent protocol.
	location ~* ^/api/agent-invocation/(.*) {
		proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
	}

	# Enable a custom 502 error page.
	# Must define template at /usr/share/nginx/html/502.html
	# error_page 502 /502.html;
    # location /502.html {
    #   index 502.html;
    # }

	location / {
		proxy_connect_timeout       605;
    proxy_send_timeout          605;
    proxy_read_timeout          605;
    send_timeout                605;
    keepalive_timeout           605;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_cache off;
    proxy_pass         http://your-server-ip:3001$request_uri;
  }
}
```
