# Meeting Minutes

The **Meeting Minutes** feature transforms RealTimeX into a powerful AI assistant for your meetings. It captures audio, provides real-time transcription, and automatically prepares the content for AI analysis.

## How it Works

Meeting Minutes operates within a specialized **Workspace Type**. When you create a Meeting Minutes workspace, the interface is optimized for recording and reviewing transcripts.

### 1. Recording & Transcription
- **Real-time Streaming**: As you speak, RealTimeX uses your selected **Transcription Model** to provide a live preview of the text.
- **High Accuracy**: Use local models like Whisper or cloud-based providers for high-speed, high-accuracy transcripts.
- **Timestamps**: Every chunk of text is automatically timestamped for easy reference.

### 2. Post-Meeting Processing
Once you stop the recording, RealTimeX performs several automated actions:
- **Audio Storage**: Saves a high-quality audio recording (`.wav`) of the session.
- **Markdown Export**: Generates a clean, timestamped transcript in Markdown format.
- **Automated Renaming**: An AI Agent analyzes the transcript to give the meeting a descriptive title (e.g., "GTM Strategy Sync" instead of "New Meeting").

### 3. AI Analysis (RAG Integration)
This is where the magic happens. The transcript is immediately ingested back into the workspace's chat context. You can immediately ask your AI Agent:
- *"Summarize the key decisions from this meeting."*
- *"What were the action items for John?"*
- *"Did we discuss the budget for Q3?"*

## Setting Up Meeting Minutes

1.  **Create Workspace**: Click the **+** button next to Workspaces and select **Meeting Minutes** as the workspace type.
2.  **Select Tools**: Ensure you have an active **Transcription Model** configured in **Settings** → **Transcription**.
3.  **Start Recording**: Click the **Record** button to begin the session.
4.  **Stop & Save**: Click **Stop** when the meeting ends. The transcript and audio will appear in your chat history instantly.

**Multi-User Meetings**
For best results in multi-user environments, ensure your microphone is positioned centrally or use a dedicated meeting room speakerphone. RealTimeX will attempt to differentiate speakers based on context, but clear audio is key.

## Viewing Past Meetings
All your meetings are saved as threads within your Meeting Minutes workspace. You can switch between threads to view the audio, transcript, and previous AI chats for any past session.
