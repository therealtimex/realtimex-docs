# Syncing from the Marketplace

The RealTimeX Marketplace is seamlessly integrated with your desktop and cloud instances. Syncing allows you to instantly import complex configurations without manual setup.

## Finding Items

Browse the [RealTimeX Marketplace](https://marketplace.realtimex.ai) to find items that suit your needs. You can filter by category, search by name, or browse featured items from the community.

1.  Find an item you like.
2.  Click **Get** or **Add to Instance**. 
3.  This will link the item to your marketplace account.

## Syncing to your Instance

Once an item is added to your account, you need to sync it to your local RealTimeX application:

1.  Open **RealTimeX Desktop** or your cloud instance.
2.  Navigate to the relevant settings page (e.g., **Settings** → **Agent Flows** or **Settings** → **Local Apps**).
3.  Click the **Sync from Marketplace** button (or look for the marketplace icon in the header).
4.  RealTimeX will authenticate with the hub and list your available "purchased" items.
5.  Click **Install** or **Sync** next to the item.

## Resolving and Configuring Items

Some items require additional setup after syncing to work in your specific environment:

### Local Apps (Compatible Mode)
When syncing a Local App, you may be prompted to:
- Run the **Auto-Setup Schema** for Supabase.
- Provide local environment variables.
- Select the workspace where the app should be active.

### Agent Flows
Newly synced flows appear in your **Agent Flows** list. You may need to:
- Verify that all required **Agent Skills** are installed.
- Configure flow-specific variables (found in the Flow Variables block).

### MCP Servers
Syncing an MCP server will add its configuration to your **MCP Management** page. If the server requires authentication (like an API key), you will see a **Setup Required** status until you provide the necessary credentials.

**Automatic Updates**
When a developer updates an item you've synced, you'll see an "Update Available" badge in your instance. Simply click sync again to pull the latest version safely without losing your local credentials.
