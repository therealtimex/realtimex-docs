# RealTimeX Calendar

The **RealTimeX Calendar** is a unified planning tool built directly into the application. It helps you keep track of automated tasks, agent schedules, and manual events in one place.

## Key Features

- **Unified View**: See all your tasks and events in a standard daily, weekly, or monthly calendar view.
- **Automated Scheduling**: AI Agents and Agent Flows can automatically create calendar events for tasks that need manual review or have specific deadlines.
- **Reminders**: Configure custom reminders for your events to stay on top of your schedule.
- **Repeating Events**: Set up recurring tasks for routine maintenance or regular reporting.
- **Task Integration**: Click on many calendar events to jump directly to the associated agent task or workspace record.

## Managing Events

### Creating Events Manually
1.  Navigate to the **Calendar** tab in the main sidebar.
2.  Click on any time slot or the **Add Event** button.
3.  Provide a title, description, and time.
4.  Configure optional repeat patterns or reminders.

### Automatic Event Creation
RealTimeX often creates calendar events automatically when:
- An **Agent Flow** reaches a "Schedule" or "Human Review" block.
- A **Local App** receives a task that requires manual intervention.
- An **AI Agent** is instructed to "Set a reminder" or "Schedule a meeting" (using the Calendar tool).

## Configuration

### Event Colors
You can customize the color of your events to categorize them visually (e.g., green for completed, red for urgent, blue for personal).

### Reminders
RealTimeX supports desktop notifications for calendar reminders. Ensure you have enabled notifications in your operating system settings for the RealTimeX Desktop app.

**Privacy Note**
Like all data in RealTimeX, your calendar events are stored locally on your machine. They are never synced to a cloud provider unless you explicitly configure an external integration.
